<p>Need to boost your Magento 2 store sales and conversion? One study found that 75% of the visitor would leave the site if the store is not optimized to find things they are looking for in an easy way. Product information plays an important role in selecting the right product your customers want to purchase. Also, Baymard&rsquo;s study found that only about 46% of overall eCommerce stores are optimized in a proper way. Other stores suffer due to little to no content on their website&rsquo;s product listing pages. Therefore, you need a solution that provides customers with sufficient product information on the product listing pages so that your customers can make better-informed decisions.</p>
